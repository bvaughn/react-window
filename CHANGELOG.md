Changelog
------------

##### 1.0.2

* 🎉 Enable Babel `annotate-pure-calls` option so that classes compiled by "transform-es2015-classes" are annotated with `#__PURE__`. This enables [UglifyJS to remove them if they are not referenced](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/pull/1448), improving dead code elimination in application code. ([Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist) - [#20](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/pull/20))
* 🎉 Update "rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external" and use new `includeDependencies` flag so that the "memoize-one" dependency does not get inlined into the Rollup bundle. ([Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist) - [#19](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/pull/19))
* 🎉 Enable [Babel "loose" mode](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#loose) to reduce package size (-8%). ([Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist) - [#18](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/pull/18))
